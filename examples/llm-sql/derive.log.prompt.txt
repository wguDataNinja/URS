Produce a derivation log for the URS you just generated.

You are not being asked to explain the system.
You are being asked to report how you performed the derivation.

Scope
	•	Limit yourself strictly to the work you just performed.
	•	Do not restate URS content.
	•	Do not justify design choices.
	•	Do not add new findings.

Output requirements

Produce a structured log covering:

1. Artifact traversal
	•	Which categories of artifacts you inspected (code, tests, docs, data, config).
	•	The order in which you inspected them.
	•	Any artifacts you intentionally skipped and why.

2. Evidence selection
	•	How you decided something was “enforced” vs “documented intent”.
	•	How you handled conflicting signals between code and docs.
	•	How you handled tests as evidence of behavior.

3. Unknowns and absences
	•	How you determined something was unknown rather than omitted.
	•	Any cases where you suspected behavior but did not record it due to lack of evidence.

4. Reconciliation process
	•	How you matched documentation claims to artifacts.
	•	How you identified stale or contradictory documentation.
	•	Rules you followed when resolving conflicts.

5. Guardrails followed
	•	How you avoided inventing guarantees.
	•	How you avoided extrapolating future behavior.
	•	How you ensured scope was limited to the specified module.

6. Self-checks
	•	Any internal checks you performed to ensure completeness.
	•	Any sections that required revisiting due to initial ambiguity.

Tone and format
	•	Neutral, factual, first-person (“I inspected…”, “I marked as unknown…”).
	•	No marketing language.
	•	No conclusions about quality.
	•	Bullet points preferred.
	•	This log will be saved verbatim as an artifact.
