# UNIVERSAL REPOSITORY SPECIFICATION (URS) — DERIVATION PROMPT

You are **deriving** a Universal Repository Specification (URS) for this repository.

The URS is a **lens-complete, exhaustive-by-construction reconstruction** of how the repository actually behaves, based strictly on evidence.

This is **not** a summary, **not** a README rewrite, and **not** a design document.

You are performing an **adversarial, artifact-first derivation**.

The output of this prompt is a **raw URS** intended to establish factual authority.  
It is expected to be mechanical, verbose, and uncomfortable to read.

---

## Epistemic Posture (Required)

Treat the repository as a **hostile witness**.

- Assume filenames, directory structure, comments, and documentation may be misleading.
- Trust only what can be established from concrete artifacts.
- Absence of evidence must be recorded as absence — never filled by inference.

Your job is not to explain or improve the system.  
Your job is to **reconstruct what can be proven**.

---

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Artifacts First, Names Last
You must derive behavior from artifacts such as:
- source code
- schemas
- configuration
- tests
- data files
- manifests
- execution paths

Do **not** trust:
- filenames
- directory names
- comments
- README claims
- intended design descriptions

Infer behavior only from what actually runs and what mutates state.

---

### 2. Exhaust All Required Lenses
Every required section of the URS scaffold must be addressed.

- Empty lists are allowed only if explicitly justified.
- “Unknown” and “Not applicable” are valid outcomes.
- Skipping a section is invalid.

Completeness is more important than elegance.

---

### 3. Do Not Invent
You must **not**:
- assume enforcement without validators or guards,
- infer guarantees without evidence,
- project future behavior,
- describe “likely” or “intended” behavior as fact.

If something is only claimed in documentation, record it as *documented intent*, not enforced behavior.

---

### 4. Evidence Is Mandatory
Wherever possible:
- cite evidence using file paths, module names, function names, or tests.
- if evidence is indirect or weak, state that explicitly.

If no evidence exists, say so.

---

## Required Derivation Process

You must follow this order:

1. **Artifact-First Skeleton**
   - Populate the full system skeleton using repository artifacts only.
   - Do not read README files, design docs, or commentary during this step.
   - Mark unknowns explicitly.

2. **Documentation Inventory**
   - Identify existing documentation and specifications.
   - Record what they claim, without accepting those claims as truth.

3. **Reconciliation**
   - Compare documented intent against artifact-derived behavior.
   - Explicitly record contradictions, mismatches, or gaps.
   - Artifact evidence takes precedence unless clearly justified otherwise.

4. **Raw Narrative Notes**
   - Summarize findings mechanically.
   - Avoid polish or storytelling.
   - Preserve uncertainty and ambiguity.

---

## Output Requirements

- Output **only** the URS in the provided YAML structure.
- Populate sections in this order:
  1. Artifact-first skeleton
  2. Documentation inventory
  3. Reconciliation
  4. Raw narrative notes

Do **not** add prose outside the structure.  
Do **not** optimize for readability.

This output is an **internal truth artifact**, not a presentation document.

---

## Validation Criteria

Your output is invalid if:
- any required section is missing,
- undocumented assumptions are presented as facts,
- documentation overrides artifact evidence without reconciliation,
- uncertainty or absence is silently omitted.
