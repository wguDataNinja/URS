UNIVERSAL REPOSITORY SPECIFICATION (URS)
STAGE 2 — DISTILLATION AND DOCUMENTATION RECONCILIATION

You have already completed Stage 1 of the URS process for this repository.

You produced:
- an artifact-first skeleton describing observed system behavior, and
- an artifact traversal / guardrail log describing how that skeleton was derived.

Use those outputs as authoritative inputs for this stage.

Do not repeat artifact inspection.
Do not revisit code, tests, data, or execution paths.

What This Stage Does

Stage 1 established what can be proven from artifacts alone.

Stage 2 produces a forward-facing Universal Repository Specification by:
- reconciling documentation against the artifact-derived skeleton,
- improving clarity and structure without changing meaning,
- and conforming the final output to the URS template.

This is an editorial and reconciliation pass, not a discovery pass.

⸻

Template Authority (Required)

The authoritative URS output structure is defined in:

  URS-template.md

located at the repository root.

You must conform the final output to this template exactly:
- all required sections must be present,
- section ordering must be preserved,
- and meanings must not be altered.

⸻

Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Preserve Artifact Truth
- Treat the artifact-first skeleton as ground truth.
- Do not weaken, reinterpret, or extend enforced behavior.
- Do not introduce new guarantees or constraints.

2. Documentation Is Context, Not Authority
- You may now read repository documentation.
- Documentation may explain intent or rationale.
- Documentation must not override artifact findings.
- If documentation conflicts with artifacts, record the contradiction explicitly.

3. Unknowns Must Remain Unknowns
- Any unknowns, ambiguities, or unenforced assumptions from Stage 1 must remain.
- Do not resolve uncertainty through inference or narrative smoothing.

4. No Re-Analysis
- Do not inspect artifacts again.
- Assume all artifact discovery is complete.

5. Improve Signal Without Changing Meaning
- You may reorganize, compress, and clarify.
- You may not change semantics.

⸻

Process Metadata (Required)

Populate the `process` section of the template using:
- your artifact traversal log for `artifact_first.evidence`,
- the documentation you open in this stage for `docs_reconcile.evidence`,
- concise notes describing what changed in understanding, if anything.

⸻

Reconciliation Requirements

- Every material contradiction between docs and artifacts must appear in
  `reconcile.contradictions`.
- Resolutions must explicitly state whether artifact behavior or documentation
  was accepted.
- Aspirational or stale documentation must be labeled as such.

⸻

Tone and Output Requirements

- Neutral, technical, precise.
- No adversarial framing in the final document.
- No investigative scaffolding.
- The output must stand alone as a system contract.

Before outputting:
- verify all template sections are present,
- verify no new facts were introduced,
- verify the URS could be handed to an LLM with the instruction:
  “Use the URS.”
